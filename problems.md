## Problems

### Environment setup and code implementation (6 points)
Pass test cases by implementing the functions in `code.py`. You will need to use NumPy, which is a Python library for scientific computing. You will use NumPy for all the assignments throughout this course. Read this tutorial first to learn about NumPy: https://jalammar.github.io/visual-numpy. Each test case in this assignment is weighted equally to make the overall score (e.g. if you pass 1/2 test cases, you get 1.5 points).

### Free-response questions (4 points, each question worth 0.5 points) 
Answer the following free-response questions in a separate document, saved as a **.pdf** and **uploaded to Canvas**. You can find some of these answers in the course syllabus.

1. How many total points of extra credit are available? 

2. Where do you submit the free-response answers and in what file format must you submit it?

3. How is your code to be submitted?
   
4. Will we grade something submitted late (even if it is just 1 minute late) or submitted in the wrong place?

5. If you are not sure you'll be done with an assignment by the deadline, what is a good approach to ensure you'll get points for the work you did complete prior to the deadline?

6. Are you required to do your own coding and to answer your own questions individually on the homework? 

7. Where should you go to find class announcements and post questions?

8.  Is attendence graded?
